ğŸ‘‹ i'm a graduate student at **michigan state university**, currently pursuing a **phd in physics**.  
_go green!_ ğŸŒ¿  

through computational work for my research, i've really come to like learning new coding languages and getting more into software.  
i'm currently working on a personal website (i swear i'm getting there ğŸ˜­ â€” it's *sigh* progressing slowly).
